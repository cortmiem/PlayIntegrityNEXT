# v14.1

If you don't want to use your custom props to spoof, remove the file.

On terminal as root: rm -f /data/adb/pif.json

I will try to update the fingerprint when Google bans it.

Instead reinstalling the module you only need to kill GMS unstable process.

On terminal as root: killall com.google.android.gms.unstable

When installing this version you must reboot the device.

Any problem report on GitHub :)
